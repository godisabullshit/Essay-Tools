# EssayTools by Isaak Eriksson

Using the natural language features provided by Google's API, I've began a christmas project consisting of tools that would critically analyze texts in order to write essays faster.

## Getting started

* Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/MyIsaak/EssayTools.git`
* [Read the Electron docs](https://electronjs.org/docs) to learn since it's the framework used to host this tool 
* [Read the Google Natural Language API docs](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/basics) to learn since it's the main NLP API being used

Take note that this project began as a christmas project solely for the purpose of helping students (and myself) analyze essays using common natural language techniques.
